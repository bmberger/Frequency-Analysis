WHAT I HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH: With this program, I knew I could easily do 26 if and else statements testing whether a letter matched. But, I knew that isn’t efficient and is time-consuming. So, I created an extra loop to go through. Looking at it, it seemed like it would work. However, I came into errors whether null-pointers or out of index. It looks some debugging and staring at code to see where I went wrong, but I eventually got it working.

WHAT I ENJOYED: I really enjoyed this project as I literally learned about this concept of breaking codes via frequency due to Susan Holmes giving a lecture on the topic at the introduction of one of her code breakers’ classes. I was watching over the video to get a feel for her teaching style to see if I would like to take it.
